A Sky Brightness Calculator for LSST


To efficiently survey the night sky requires a detailed knowledge of the sky brightness and how it evolves as a function of time, position of the moon, and solar activity. To develop this knowledge the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST),  as part of its simulations program, has developed an open-source python code to calculate the expected night sky emission on Cerro Pachon.  This code uses the ESO SkyCalc Sky Model Calculator (Noll et al. 2012; Jones et al. 2013) to generate a suite of 3,500 template spectra that can be interpolated to arbitrary observing conditions.  These template spectra include components for scattered moonlight, zodiacal light, airglow, scattered starlight, and upper and lower atmosphere emission. To determine how far into twilight the LSST can observe (in the z and y filters) we have extended the sky model to predict twilight sky conditions. This model is an analytic fit to observations made with a Canon all-sky camera located at the LSST site.  These observations  have been run through a photometry pipeline to generate a database with 91.5 million measurements of the sky brightness spanning a range of 311 days. From these data we find that, for sun altitudes between -11 and -20 degrees and airmasses less than 2.5, the twilight component of the sky can be fit with a model with only 4 free parameters. Early validation of the LSST sky model shows that dark-time zenith predictions match the observations with an RMS of 0.2 magnitudes. We attribute most of this variation to random variations in the weather, as the residuals show no significant trend with time of night or time of year.
