A Sky Brightness Calculator for LSST

As part of the simulations effort for the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST), we have developed an open-source python code to calculate the expected night sky emission on Cerro Pachon.  Our code uses the ESO SkyCalc Sky Model Calculator (Noll et al. 2012; Jones et al. 2013) to generate a suite of 3,500 template spectra that can be interpolated to arbitrary observing conditions.  These template spectra include components for scattered moonlight, zodiacal light, airglow, scattered starlight, and upper and lower atmosphere emission.

With z and y filters in the near IR, we expect LSST will be able to observe well into twilight sky conditions. In addition to the ESO model, we have developed an all-sky model for twilight sky conditions. Our twilight model is an analytic fit to observations made with a Canon all-sky camera located at the LSST site.  We find that for sun altitudes between -11 and -20 degrees and airmasses less than 2.5, the twilight component of the sky can be fit with a model with only 4 free parameters.

Observations from the Canon all-sky camera have been run through a photometry pipeline to generate a database with 91.5 million measurements of the sky brightness spanning a range of 311 days.  We have used this database to verify the sky brightness model.  We find that the dark-time zenith predictions match the observations with an RMS of 0.2 magnitudes. We attribute most of this variation to random variations in the weather, as the residuals show no significant trend with time of night or time of year.
